# RaspiMusicServer

This an music server on Raspeberry pi with Grovepi and Arduino.
The server plays music by mpc and can be controlled by a joystick, a button. Audio volume can be changed by a slide bar.
Power supply is managed by Arduino with a button safely. We don't need to take care of timing of turning on/off Raspi.

## Software

### Arduino

Arduino controls power supply of Raspberry pi.
arduino/control_power.ino shall be loaded into Arduino.

### Raspberry pi

1. Communication with Arduino
"shutdown_check/shutdown_check.py" shall be run from /etc/rc.local by super user.

2. Install mpd/mpc

3. Set a playlist as you want

4. Music server application
"audioserver/run.sh" shall be from cron by pi user.

5. Connect either a speaker or a DAC
I connected a USB DAC.
